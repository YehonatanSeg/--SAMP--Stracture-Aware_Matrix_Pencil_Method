## Structure-Aware Matrix Pencil Method (SAMP) and SAMP++

The MATLAB code in this repository accompanies the papers entitled 
1. "Structure-Aware Matrix Pencil Method", and reproduces the results in Section VII (Numerical Results) utilizing the SAMP Algorithm (Proposed Algorithm).
2. "SAMP++: Robust Structure-Aware Matrix Pencil", and reproduces the results in Section V (Numerical Results) utilizing the SAMP++ Algorithm (Proposed Algorithm).

This code was developed by Yehonatan-Itay Segman.

To reproduce the SAMP figures, download the 'SAMP' and 'toolbox' folders and run the files in 'SAMP' folder.
To reproduce the SAMP++ figures, download the 'SAMP++' and 'toolbox' folders and run the files in 'SAMP++' folder.
